abstract = {Combinatorial optimization problems are one of the target applications of current quantum technology, mainly because of their industrial relevance, the difficulty of solving large instances of them classically, and their equivalence to Ising Hamiltonians using the quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) formulation. Many of these applications have inequality constraints, usually encoded as penalization terms in the QUBO formulation using additional variables known as slack variables. The slack variables have two disadvantages: (i) these variables extend the search space of optimal and suboptimal solutions, and (ii) the variables add extra qubits and connections to the quantum algorithm. Recently, a new method known as unbalanced penalization has been presented to avoid using slack variables. This method offers a trade-off between additional slack variables to ensure that the optimal solution is given by the ground state of the Ising Hamiltonian, and using an unbalanced heuristic function to penalize the region where the inequality constraint is violated with the only certainty that the optimal solution will be in the vicinity of the ground state. This work tests the unbalanced penalization method using real quantum hardware on D-Wave Advantage for the traveling salesman problem (TSP). The results show that the unbalanced penalization method outperforms the solutions found using slack variables and sets a new record for the largest TSP solved with quantum technology.},

abstract = {Solving combinatorial optimization problems of the kind that can be codified by quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) is a promising application of quantum computation. Some problems of this class suitable for practical applications such as the traveling salesman problem (TSP), the bin packing problem (BPP), or the knapsack problem (KP) have inequality constraints that require a particular cost function encoding. The common approach is the use of slack variables to represent the inequality constraints in the cost function. However, the use of slack variables increases considerably the number of qubits and operations required to solve these problems using quantum devices. In this work, we present an alternative method that does not require extra slack variables and consists of using an unbalanced penalization function to represent the inequality constraints in the QUBO. This function is characterized by having a larger penalization when the inequality constraint is not achieved than when it is. We tested our approach for the TSP, the BPP, and the KP. For all of them, we are able to encode the optimal solution in the vicinity of the cost Hamiltonian ground state. This new approach can be used to solve combinatorial problems with inequality constraints with a reduced number of resources compared to the slack variables approach using quantum annealing or variational quantum algorithms.},

@book{Montanez-Barrera2022,
abstract = {This paper presents a general method for producing randomly perturbed density operators subject to different sets of constraints. The perturbed density operators are a specified “distance" away from the state described by the original density operator. This approach is applied to a bipartite system of qubits and used to examine the sensitivity of various entanglement measures on the perturbation magnitude. The constraint sets used include constant energy, constant entropy, and both constant energy and entropy. The method is then applied to produce perturbed random quantum states that correspond with those obtained experimentally for Bell states on the IBM quantum device ibmq_manila. The results show that the methodology can be used to simulate the outcome of real quantum devices where noise, which is important both in theory and simulation, is present.},

@article{MontanezBarrera2022,
abstract = {Accurate pressure drop estimation in forced boiling phenomena is important during the thermal analysis and the geometric design of cryogenic heat exchangers. However, current methods to predict the pressure drop have one of two problems: lack of accuracy or generalization to different situations. In this work, we present the correlated-informed neural networks (CoINN), a new paradigm in applying the artificial neural network (ANN) technique combined with a successful pressure drop correlation as a mapping tool to predict the pressure drop of zeotropic mixtures in micro-channels. The proposed approach is inspired by Transfer Learning, highly used in deep learning problems with reduced datasets. Our method improves the ANN performance by transferring the knowledge of the Sun & Mishima correlation for the pressure drop to the ANN. The correlation having physical and phenomenological implications for the pressure drop in micro-channels considerably improves the performance and generalization capabilities of the ANN. The final architecture consists of three inputs: the mixture vapor quality, the micro-channel inner diameter, and the available pressure drop correlation. The results show the benefits gained using the correlated-informed approach predicting experimental data used for training and a posterior test with a mean relative error (mre) of 6%, lower than the Sun & Mishima correlation of 13%. Additionally, this approach can be extended to other mixtures and experimental settings, a missing feature in other approaches for mapping correlations using ANNs for heat transfer applications.},

@article{Montanez-Barrera2022,
abstract = {The current stage of quantum computing technology, called noisy intermediate-scale quantum technology, is characterized by large errors that prohibit it from being used for real applications. In these devices, decoherence, one of the main sources of error, is generally modeled by Markovian master equations such as the Lindblad master equation. In this paper, the decoherence phenomena are addressed from the perspective of the steepest-entropy-ascent quantum thermodynamics framework in which the noise is in part seen as internal to the system. The framework is as well used to describe changes in the energy associated with environmental interactions. Three scenarios, an inversion recovery demonstration, a Ramsey demonstration, and a two-qubit entanglement-disentanglement demonstration, are used to demonstrate the applicability of this framework, which provides good results relative to the demonstrations and the Lindblad equation; it does so, however, from a different perspective as to the cause of the decoherence. These demonstrations are conducted on the IBM superconducting quantum device ibmq_bogota.},

abstract = {We consider Type IIB compactifications on an isotropic torus $T^6$ threaded by geometric and non geometric fluxes. For this particular setup we apply supervised machine learning techniques, namely an artificial neural network coupled to a genetic algorithm, in order to obtain more than sixty thousand flux configurations yielding to a scalar potential with at least one critical point. We observe that both stable AdS vacua with large moduli masses and small vacuum energy as well as unstable dS vacua with small tachyonic mass and large energy are absent, in accordance to the Refined de Sitter Conjecture. Moreover, by considering a hierarchy among fluxes, we observe that perturbative solutions with small values for the vacuum energy and moduli masses are favored, as well as scenarios in which the lightest modulus mass is much greater than the corresponding AdS vacuum scale. Finally we apply some results on Random Matrix Theory to conclude that the most probable mass spectrum derived from this string setup is that satisfying the Refined de Sitter and AdS scale conjectures.},

abstract={As has been shown elsewhere, a reasonable model of the loss of entanglement or correlation that occurs in quantum computations is one which assumes that they can effectively be predicted by a framework that presupposes the presence of irreversibilities internal to the system. It is based on the steepest-entropy-ascent principle and is used here to reproduce the behavior of a controlled-PHASE gate in good agreement with experimental data. The results show that the loss of entanglement predicted is related to the irreversibilities in a nontrivial way, providing a possible alternative approach that warrants exploration to that conventionally used to predict the loss of entanglement. The results provide a means for understanding this loss in quantum protocols from a nonequilibrium thermodynamic standpoint. This framework permits the development of strategies for extending either the maximum fidelity of the computation or the entanglement time.},

@article{Vargas-Jaramillo2019,
abstract = {Details are presented of the development and incorporation of a generation and transmission reliability approach in an upper-level sustainability assessment framework for power system planning. This application represents a quasi-stationary, multiobjective optimization problem with nonlinear constraints, load uncertainties, stochastic effects for renewable energy producers, and the propagation of uncertainties along the transmission lines. The Expected Energy Not Supplied (EENS) accounts for generation and transmission reliability and is based on a probabilistic as opposed to deterministic approach. The optimization is developed for three scenarios. The first excludes uncertainties in the load demand, while the second includes them. The third scenario accounts not only for these uncertainties, but also for the stochastic effects related to wind and photovoltaic producers. The sustainability-reliability approach is applied to the standard IEEE Reliability Test System. Results show that using a Mixture of Normals Approximation (MONA) for the EENS formulation makes the reliability analysis simpler, as well as possible within a large-scale optimization. In addition, results show that the inclusion of renewable energy producers has some positive impact on the optimal synthesis/design of power networks under sustainability considerations. Also shown is the negative impact of renewable energy producers on the reliability of the power network.},

@article{Barroso-Maldonado2019,
abstract = {A crucial aspect of Joule-Thomson cryocooler analysis and optimization is the accurate estimation of frictional pressure drop. This paper presents a pressure drop model for boiling of non-azeotropic mixtures of nitrogen with hydrocarbons (e.g., methane, ethane, and propane) in microchannels. These refrigerant mixtures are important for their applicability in natural gas liquefaction plants. The pressure drop model is based on computational intelligence techniques, and its performance is evaluated with the mean relative error (mre), and compared with three correlations previously selected as most accurate: Awad and Muzychka; Sun and Mishima; and Cicchitti et al. Comparison between the proposed artificial neural network (ANN) model and the three correlations shows the advantages of the ANN to predict pressure drop for non-azeotropic mixtures. Existing correlations predict experimental data within mre = 23.9–25.3%, while the ANN has mre = 8.3%. Additional features of the ANN model include: (1) applicability to laminar, transitional and turbulent flow, and (2) demonstrated applicability to experiments not used in the training process. Therefore, the ANN model is recommended for predicting pressure drop due to accuracy and ease of applicability.},
