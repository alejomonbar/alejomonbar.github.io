I am a postdoctoral researcher at the Jülich Supercomputing Centre (JSC) within the Forschungszentrum Jülich, Germany. My research focuses on combinatorial optimization using both analog and digital quantum computing, simulation of quantum systems using supercomputing, and cross-platform evaluation of quantum devices.

In addition to my research, I have contributed to the development of various quantum computing libraries, including Qiskit, Pennylane, D-Wave Ocean, and OpenQAOA. My contribution to the development of OpenQAOA earned my a grant from Unitary Fund for the advancement of combinatorial optimization applications in quantum computing.

I hold a bachelor's degree in electromechanical engineering from the Pedagogical and Technological University of Colombia (UPTC). I earned both a Master's and a Ph.D. (Summa cum laude) in mechanical engineering from the University of Guanajuato.
