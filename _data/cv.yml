      description:
        - The steepest-entropy-ascent quantum thermodynamics (SEAQT) framework is used to model the evolution of a spin atom when it is driven out of equilibrium by a fast quenched in its Hamiltonian. This model is compared with a recent experimental approach that measures two representations of irreversibility generation, the Kullback-Leibler relative entropy, and the average entropy generation for different quenching times.
